Trello Clone in vanilla Javascript - Inspired by Web Dev Cohort 1.0 🚀

---

Introduction 🎯
This project is a basic Trello clone, built using Vanilla JavaScript and CSS. The idea was inspired by the amazing teaching of Ajay B Panigrahi, a fellow student in the Web Dev Cohort 1.0, led by Hitesh Choudhary and Piyush Garg. The cohort is part of the incredible developer community called ChaiCode, which has played a crucial role in shaping our learning journey.

Without the guidance and mentorship of Hitesh sir and Piyush sir, this wouldn't have been possible. Ajay’s deep understanding and teaching skills in JavaScript have been instrumental in helping fellow students, including myself, grasp key concepts and build real-world projects like this.
